Subject: [PATCH] Fix buffer overflows occurring reading redis.conf.

There was not enough sanity checking in the code loading the slots of
Redis Cluster from the nodes.conf file, this resulted into the
attacker's ability to write data at random addresses in the process
memory, by manipulating the index of the array. The bug seems
exploitable using the following techique: the config file may be altered so
that one of the nodes gets, as node ID (which is the first field inside the
structure) some data that is actually executable: then by writing this
address in selected places, this node ID part can be executed after a
jump. So it is mostly just a matter of effort in order to exploit the
bug. In practice however the issue is not very critical because the
bug requires an unprivileged user to be able to modify the Redis cluster
nodes configuration, and at the same time this should result in some
gain. However Redis normally is unprivileged as well. Yet much better to
have this fixed indeed.

Fix #4278.
